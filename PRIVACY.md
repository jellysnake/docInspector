This document details the privacy policies and how this application uses your Google Data.

## What do we use
This app requires the full drive read/write scope, however it doesn't use a majority of this data. The only data this application uses is the revision history of your google docs files.  
In future this may extend to other file types, such as google sheets, but will never use more than the revision history.

## How do we use it
No data from your google account is ever directly stored by this application. The data collected is simply collated and displayed to the user in the requested format.  
What the user does with the files produced by this application is not a part of this application and hence not covered by this Privacy Policy.
